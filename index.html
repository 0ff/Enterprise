			<h3>Get Enterprise</h3>
			<p>Current Version: 0.1.1</p>
            <p>Enterprise can be obtained from the official repository on Github. Click on the links below to be directed to the appropriate pages:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Stable:</strong></p>
            <p>There are currently no stable releases.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Unstable:</strong></p>
            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);">Version 0.1.1</a> (19 December 2013)</p>
            
            <p>Please note that obtaining Enterprise in this fashion means doing lots of setup work. If you simply want to create a bootable USB, please consider using <a href="http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/" target="_blank">Mac Linux USB Loader</a>, which sets up Enterprise for you.</p>

			<p>Enterprise (named after the Starship Enterprise from <em>Star Trek</em>) is an EFI program that is designed to assist in booting Linux distributions on USB sticks on Intel Macs, something that is continously regarded as being near to impossible due to EFI quirks and really quite poor support from Linux distributions.</p>
            <p>The program is quite unique. It is written in C, and can be compiled to run on both 32&#45;bit and 64&#45;bit EFI firmware types. Right now, all official downloads are for the <strong>64-bit architecture</strong> only.</p>
            <p>It is designed to compliment <a href="http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/" target="_blank">Mac Linux USB Loader</a>, though it can also be used separately (albeit with some setup work). The purpose of Enterprise is as the first stage in a two-stage booting process for Mac Linux USB Loader-created USB drives.</p>
            <p>Please note that this page is oriented for technical users, such as hardware and/or software enthuasists, programmers, and people who like to hack their firmware. It is not intended for casual users &#45; beware!</p>
            
            <h4>The Basics</h4>
            
            <p>Once upon a time, everything was happy in computer-land. Our PCs were booting, our memory sufficed, and the children were happy. But then Mr. Turing had to curse us with the &lt;sarcasm&gt; evil of technological progress &lt;&frasl;sarcasm&gt;, and eventually our nice, peaceful solutions didn't work anymore. All of a sudden, our multi&#45;terabyte drives couldn't be booted from, and our old 16&#45;bit BIOSes couldn't boot our cool, newfangled 64&#45;bit multicore operating systems. Woe was us!</p>
            <p>But our computer engineers, clever as they are, dug up an old, largely forgotten future&#45;proof boot specification, UEFI. </p>

            <h4>Installation and Use</h4>

            <p>Enterprise is intended as a tool to be used alongside Mac Linux USB Loader, and so it is not really intended to be installed in the same manner as one would install a traditional bootloader like GRUB. That being said, it is possible to use Enterprise without Mac Linux USB Loader, as they are wholly separate tools, however in this circumstance additional setup is required.</p>
            <p>To get the best performance from Enterprise, and to take advantage of any super cool stuff I add to it, you should download the source code, as the official repository includes a number of tools to assist in setup.</p>
