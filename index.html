	<h1>Enterprise: EFI Linux Loader</h1>
    <h3>A Slightly Pompous Attempt to Boot Linux on Intel Macs</h3>
    
    <p>Enterprise (named after the Starship Enterprise from <i>Star Trek</i>), is an EFI program that is designed to assist in loading
     Linux distributions on USB sticks on Intel Macs, something that is continously regarded as being near to impossible due to 
     EFI quirks.</p>
     <p>The program is quite unique. It is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a>,
     and will be compiled to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit EFI firmware types.</p>
